## Dineat
A web app to find your favorite restaurants and reserve a table with voice assistance and automation.

## How to use the application
Go to https://dineat.herokuapp.com/

Use the following credentials to login as a user <br>
username: aditshah8 <br>
password: test@test@123

Now use the voice button or type in your query to search for restaurants.

For testing use "Yanki Sizzlers" in your search query or the cuisine this restaurant serves. (Because I just remember this restaurant's password only.)

Type in the booking details or use the orange button to start the voice assistant.

After the booking is done, there will be a QR ticket generated. Use the ticket for restaurant check-in.

Now to validate the booking we need to Sign in as a restaurant. To do that click on Eatery button in the login Modal use the following credentials: <br>
